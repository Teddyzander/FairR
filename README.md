# Robustness-Of-Fairness-2.0

## Description

Project developed by [Edward Small](https://www.admscentre.org.au/edward-small/) and [Dr. Wei Shao](https://swsamleo.github.io/wei_shao.github.io/) to measure the stability and consistency of models that pertain to give fair solutions.

If fairness of an AI $f$ over an input space $X$ is measured using a probability function $M(f, X)$, then robustness $R$ is measured via:

$R_k=\frac{M(f,X+\epsilon_k)}{M(f,X)}$ for $k>0$

where $\epsilon_k$ is a perturbation to the input space, and $k$ is the strength of this perturbation.

We desire combinations of models $f$, data $X$ and measures $M$ such that $R_k \leq 1$ for $k>0$.

## Instructions

To use the code, create a local copy using the git URL and install the required packages using _pip install -r requirements.txt_. The code was written using python 3.9

The following is a list of command line arguments:

* **--dataset 'dataset name'** is the name of the dataset you wish to run (from the current list of accessible data sets). See [the folktables](https://github.com/zykls/folktables) for details of the ACS data sets. List of pre-built data sets is in data_util/fetch_data.py in the get_data function.
* **--train_constraint 'constraint'** is the fairness training constraints. dp is demographic parity, eo is equalised odds, fp is false positive, and tp is true positive.
* **--output_dir 'name'** is the name of the output directory for all the data and plots
* **--min_noise 'number'** is the minimum number for $k$.
* **--max_noise 'number'** is the maximum number for $k$.
* **--noise_iters 'number'** is the number of iterations per value of $k$ (this is because some methods involve an element of randomness).
* **--model_iters 'number'** is the maximum number of iterations to fit each model.
* **--model_type 'model name'** is the type of model we wish to use (eg SVC is support vectors, LR is logistic regression, etc).
* **--step_size 'number'** is the step size between each noise level.
* **--roc 'True/False'** decides whether to create and display the ROC curve.
